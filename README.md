## About
#### Hi, I am Waqar Zahour.

I have more than 10 years of experience in the software industry. I did my master in computer science from [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/). 
I am polyglot like **Python**,  **Swift**, and **Objective-C**. Avid to explore a new restaurant and enjoys good food. Loves to
read books, watching movies and playing table tennis.

> _**Fun factoids:**_  
Check keyboard works by typing "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG."  
Your brain will stop thinking when contradiction occurs "A PERFUME WITHOUT FRAGRANCE."
The hardest job is "TO SQUEEZE YOUR WARDROBE."
Doesn't matter how many time you fail in an interview "IT WILL REFLECT ON YOUR RESUME."

## Skills
Less is more, I specialize in the field of development.

`Swift`   `Python`  `VI Editor`   `Tmux`   `AWS - Basics`
